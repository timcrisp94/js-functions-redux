    <h2>What is a function?</h2>
      <p>A function is a reusable block of code written to perform a single purpose.</p>
      <p>Functions optionally accept data as input and return a single piece of data.</p>
      <p>"We want to think of functions as little universes that we create that do a task which somehow affect the outside world" -Shahzad</p>
      <p>"Our mental models about functions are to consider doing our best to make them reusable, to make them simpler, and to make them do one thing at a time" -Shah</p>

    <h2>Object-oriented vs. Functional Programming</h2>
    <h4>Object-Oriented Programming</h4>
      <p> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming">OOP </a> is a programming paradigm fundamental to many programming langues. Object-oriented programming is about modeling a system as a collection of objects, which each represent some particular aspect of the system. An object provides a public interface to other code that wants to use it, but maintains its own private internal state: meaning other parts of the system don't have to know what's going on inside the object</p>
      <p>Imperative - you are telling the computer how to do everything</p>
    <h4>Functional Programming</h4>
      <p> <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0"></a> Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.</p>
